A zeroclick attack, also known as a zero interaction attack, is a type of cyberattack in which the attacker is able to compromise a victim's device without any interaction from the victim. This can be done by exploiting vulnerabilities in software or hardware, or by tricking the victim into installing malicious software.

Zeroclick attacks are worth millions because they can be used to steal sensitive data, such as passwords, credit card numbers, and Social Security numbers. They can also be used to install malware on the victim's device, which can then be used to launch other attacks or to steal data.

Zeroclick attacks are particularly dangerous because they are difficult to detect and prevent. Since no interaction is required from the victim, they can be carried out without the victim's knowledge or consent. Additionally, zeroclick attacks can be very targeted, meaning that the attacker can choose their victims specifically.

Here are some examples of zeroclick attacks:
Exploiting a vulnerability in a messaging app. The attacker sends a malicious message to the victim. When the victim opens the message, the vulnerability is exploited and the attacker's malware is installed on the victim's device.
Exploiting a vulnerability in an operating system. The attacker creates a malicious website or email attachment. When the victim visits the website or opens the attachment, the vulnerability is exploited and the attacker's malware is installed on the victim's device.
Tricking the victim into installing malicious software. The attacker creates a fake website or app that looks like a legitimate website or app. The victim downloads and installs the fake website or app, which then installs the attacker's malware on the victim's device.
Zeroclick attacks are a serious threat to cybersecurity, and it is important to be aware of them and to take steps to protect yourself. Here are some tips for protecting yourself from zeroclick attacks:

Keep your software and hardware up to date. Software and hardware updates often include security patches that can fix vulnerabilities that could be exploited by attackers.
Be careful about what links you click on and what attachments you open. Only click on links and open attachments from trusted sources.
Use a strong antivirus program and keep it up to date. A good antivirus program can help to protect you from malware, including malware that is installed through zeroclick attacks.
Be careful about what apps you install and where you install them from. Only install apps from trusted sources, such as the official app store for your device.
If you think that you may have been the victim of a zeroclick attack, it is important to take steps to protect your device and your data. You should immediately change your passwords and scan your device for malware. You should also contact your bank and credit card companies to let them know that you may have been a victim of fraud.
